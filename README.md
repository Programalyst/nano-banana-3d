# Nano Banana enhanced Image to 3D Model
![Preview of the UI](./images/banana-to-3d-ui.png)

Nano-banana is very good at generating views of the same character/object from different camera angles. This is great for generating the â‰ˆ (front, back, sides) which are traditionally created before 3D models are created. Models that output 3D models give better results with multiple views of the object provided.

I use Tencent's Hunyuan 2.0 MultiView which is available via FAL.ai

## Quickstart

1. Run frontend client - 
```bash
    cd banana3d-client
    # ensure that the SERVER_URL in `App.tsx` is set to `http://127.0.0.1:5500`
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

2. Run backend server -
```bash
    cd banana3d-server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    source .venv/bin/activate
    hypercorn main:app --reload --bind 127.0.0.1:5500
```


### Gemini Integration

3 API calls are made to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (aka Nano Banana) during the generation of the view images. 
The first call generates the front image. Subsequent calls include the original image and all subsequently generated images in the prompt to try to maintain subject consistency. 

`hunyuan3d/v2/multi-view` only requires the front, back and left images so the right image is not generated.


### FAL.ai Integration

Before the hunyuan model can be invoked, the view images generated by nano-banana must be uploaded to **FAL.ai**. This is done by `fal_client.upload_file_async(view_image_path),` in `falGen3d.py`
